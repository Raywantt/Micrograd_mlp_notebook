# Micrograd_mlp_notebook
This repository contains an educational Jupyter Notebook that implements a minimal automatic differentiation engine (micrograd) and builds a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) from scratch in Python.Itâ€™s an ideal resource for understanding the underlying mechanics of neural network training without the overhead of large frameworks.
